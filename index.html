    <h1>Abdi Osman's Professional Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>My name is Abdi Osman. I am currently a senior at Syracuse University studying Information Managment & Technology. I created this portfolio to demonstrate what I've learned through hands-on labs and real-world projects that showcase my technical and analytical skills.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Osman's Rental Shop</strong><br>
            A sleek, user-friendly website for an exotic car rental business. This project demonstrates both my front-end design skills and my understanding of secure, intuitive user experiences. Visitors can browse luxury vehicles, see pricing, and start the booking process directly online. It also serves as a portfolio sample that can be viewed live or downloaded.<br>
